\textbf{I'm not quite sure how math discussion sections work typically. In Biology we tend to blovate a lot here 
putting things into context and figuring out why this is a valuable thing to be added to the literature.  However,
I think that may not be the apporach you are trying to do.  As a consequence, I just minimally edited this section 
after reworking the first paragraph a bit. }

Each factor that influences the behavior of pollinators may thus have large effects on the spatial distribution of pollination. Because plants rely upon pollinators for reproduction, the way in which these animals move across the landscape may have significant impacts on plant population structure and diversity. Reductions in the distance of pollination evenets or the size of the potential population contributing pollen can have significant impacts including inbreeding, loss of genetic diversity, and local extinction.  As such, understanding which parameters are most influential in models that accurately describe pollination becomes a critical tool for both conservation and management policies.  Adopting a simualtion approach, as presented here, provides a powerful method for studying pollination given the logistical difficulties associated with direct field monitoring.  By far, the most striking result of these model is the extent to which devaitions from random diffusion impact pollination distances and the consequences for paternity in the plant populations. 

The majority of models studying pollination have assumed a purely random diffusion process. There is
clear evidence that there are differences in statistics seen between plants pollinated through wind
dispersal from those pollinated through animal dispersal \cite{LevinKerster}.  It is demonstrated here through
an agent based correlated random walk that if an animal is not moving in a purely random fashion,
then important pollination statistics can be dramatically affected. 

As can be seen in the results section the magnitude of turning angle had varying degrees of effects
over different plant densities and therefore pollination patterns predicted by a model assuming a
purely random walk could be vastly different from a model assuming a correlated random walk. For
high plant densities, the effects of correlated random walk was less pronounced than that of low
plant densities, except for the \emph{average weighted diversity of fathers}. In the case of
\emph{average weighted diversity of fathers} the affect of turning angle magnitudes were more
pronounced for high densities. Therefore, although diffusion models for densely populated plant
species may not vary greatly from models that assume a correlated random walk for \emph{average
pollination distance} or \emph{average maximum pollination distance} they will vary significantly
for \emph{average weighted diversity of fathers}. This has the affect of under estimating the
diversity of pollination for high plant densities and animal dispersal as compared to similar plant
densities and wind dispersal.

The variation between correlated random walk and that of a purely random walk is significant at low
plant densities for the statistics such as \emph{average maximum distance}, \emph{average
pollination distance}, and \emph{average maximum pollination distance} and so for the case of low
plant densities the assumption of a purely random walk may lend to bias in the analysis of
pollination. Most studies to date have been conducted on small herbaceous plant species whose
densities tend to be high. Even though most of the animals statistics presented were not greatly
influenced by turning angle for high plant densities the average weighted diversity of fathers had was
still greatly affected by the turning angle at these densities, and therefore an assumption of a
purely random walk would be an inappropriate assumption and at any of the densities examined in this
study. Therefore a correlated random walk may be a better approximation to animal movement.
