In this study, an agent-based model simulates the pollination of plants in a forest. The model assumes
continuous space and consists of two interacting agents; \emph{pollinators} and \emph{plants}.  We
consider different plant densities to determine what effect density has on the distribution of
pollen.  The plants have a limited supply of pollen that can be gathered by pollinators.  Pollinators in turn 
transport pollen across the landscape using particular movement rules during normal foraging.  In this model, movement is 
determined by a corrolated random walk.  At each step, pollinators examine the local neighborhood for plants 
where they will collect additional pollen and deposit pollen.  

\subsection{Movement} 

Movement in the model is centered on the pollinators.  Pollen is carried from one plant to another. 
At each step the movement of anpollinatorators in conducted in two stages: \emph{searching} and \emph{movement}.  
First, the pollinator checks a neighborhood of radius $r$ to see if there are any plants within the neighborhood.  
If there are one or more plants, the pollinator chooses the closest.  It there are two or more that are 
equidistant from the pollinator, one is randomly chosen.  

If there are no plants within a distance $r$ from the current location of the pollinator, the pollinators 
movement is defined using a correlated random walk.  For the correlated random walk, the pollinator chooses a
direction based on a probability distribution in which the higher probabilities are centered about
the their current direction, see \autoref{TurningAngle}.  The pollinator then takes a step of
length between 0 and 1 distributed uniformly in the new chosen direction.  This length is denoted by
$s_j^{(i)}$, which is the $j^{th}-$step taken by the $i^{th}$ pollinator.

of what a path may look like.}
\end{figure}

Alternatively, if the pollinator is already at a plant, the pollinator picks a random direction uniformly
and takes a step of size $r+1.0$.  This will ensure that the pollinator will not immediately return to
the same plant on the very next step.

\subsection{Pollination}

When an pollinator is on a plant, it collects pollen, distributes pollen, and consumes food. Each simulated
plant contains a number of flowers, $\phi$, from which an pollinator may obtain pollen. When an pollinator
visits a plant it picks up pollen from one or more flowers. The number of flowers from which an
pollinator can obtain pollen is determined by the total number of flowers on a plant, the fraction of
flowers in bloom at any one time ($a$), the number of times ($j$) the plant has previously been
visited by an pollinator, and the maximum fraction of flowers available for pollination ($\eta$). The
formula for the number of total flowers available for visitation during a $k^{th}$ visit to the
$j^{th}$ plant ($f_{j,k}$) is given by

\begin{equation}\label{flowers}
f_{j,k} = \phi \cdot a \cdot \eta^k.
\end{equation}

It is assumed that the amount of food eaten and the amount of pollen collected is proportional to
the number of visited flowers. An pollinator collects pollen and eats from every flower that it
visits, and so the amount of pollen collected and the amount of food eaten is proportional to the
equation \eqref{flowers}. Let $f^{\left(i\right)}_{j,k}$ be the number of flowers visited by the
$i^{th}$ pollinator during the $k^{th}$ visit to the $j^{th}$ plant then the amount of pollen/nectar
in the $i^{th}$ pollinator's stomach after $m$ plant visits is given by

\begin{equation}
c^{\left(i\right)}_m = \sum_{j=0}^{m} \beta f^{\left(i\right)}_{j,k},
\label{limit}
\end{equation}

where $\beta$ is the proportionality constant for the amount of pollen collected at a plant.
Each pollinator has a maximum amount of food they will ingest, $c_{max}$, at which time they will stop
search for food and return to their lair. %The total amount of food that an pollinator can eat is
limited
%by the stomach size, $c_{max}$.

The fraction, $\alpha$, of all flowers are pollinated, and the associated probability that a
flower is pollinated, $\rho$, are related by the equation,

\begin{equation} \label{Prob}
\alpha = \rho \cdot \hat{f}_k.
\end{equation}

Using equation \eqref{limit} and \eqref{Prob} we can determine the probability that a flower is
pollinated, $\rho$, by the formula

\[
\rho = \frac{\alpha}{\phi} \cdot \frac{1 - \eta}{a \cdot \eta}.
\]

When a flower is pollinated it must determined which previous plant donated the pollen. Each
flower visited is recorded and is available to pollinate the current flower, except those flowers
that are on the same plant. Self- pollination, is not considered, because the likelihood of
self-pollination is low due to mechanisms that impedes self-pollination. Each flower considered
has an equal likelihood of pollinating the current flower.

\subsection{Time and Stopping Criteria}

The velocity an pollinator travels ($v$) is assumed to be constant, as well as the time spent on a
plant ($t_{plant}$).  The travel time for an pollinator is then given by the formula

\[
t^{\left(i\right)} = \frac{s^{\left(i\right)}}{v} + T^{\left(i\right)} \cdot t_{plant},
\]

where $T^{\left(i\right)}$ is the number of plants visited by the $i^{th}$ pollinator. If we let the
maximum allowable travel time be $t_{max}$, then once $t^{\left(i\right)} \geq t_{max}$ or
$c^{\left(i\right)}_m \geq c_{max}$ the pollinator is removed from the simulation. $t_{max}$ is based
on the optimal searching time during the day.  When the pollinator leaves the simulation, it is terminated.

\subsection{Model Statistics}

To best explore the inherent differences between biotic and abiotic pollination this study focuses
on the effects of movement as well as the effects of plant density.

In order to quantify these way in which the parameters influence the polliation in this system, we recorded
\emph{Average Path Distance} and \emph{Average Maximum Distance} based upon pollinators directly and 
\emph{Average Pollination Distance}, \emph{Average Maximum Pollination Distance}, and \emph{Average
Weighted Diversity of Fathers} based upon the set of pollen that was deposited at individual plants.  
The calculations of these statistics are given in the \autoref{tab:eqn}.

In these equations it is assumed that $b$ is the number of pollinators, $n$ is the total number
of plants, $(x_{1,0}^{(i)},x_{2,0}^{(i)})$ is the starting location of the $i^{th}$ pollinator,
$(x_{1,j}^{(i)},x_{2,j}^{(i)})$ is the location of the $i^{th}$ pollinator after $j$ steps,
$\tau^{(i)}$ is the total number of seeds for the $i^{th}$ plant, $\Delta\tau^{(i)}$ is the number
of different fathers contributing pollen to the $i^{th}$ plant, and $F_{j,i}$ is the number of
times the $j^{th}$ father contributed pollen to the $i^{th}$ plant.
