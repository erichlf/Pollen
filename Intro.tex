Pollination is a critical component of every ecosystem, is essential to creating
and maintaining diversity and reproduction, and is required for world crop
production \cite{KleinEtAl2007}.  There are two main vectors for pollen
movement; passive pollination where individual grains are dispersed through the
aid of wind and/or water and active pollination where an animal (most commonly
an insect) carries grains from one plant to another.  Given the size of
individual pollen grains, direct monitoring of how pollen is dispersed across
the landscape is impractical.  Several indirect approaches have been developed
including the use of pollen traps and the application of genetic paternity
approaches applied to successfully pollinated seeds
\cite{BitzerPatterson1967,StreiffEtAl1999}.  While these approaches are able to
quantify the end result of the dispersal process, they provide no information on
the specifics of the precise transport mechanism, which is critical because
different features of the landscape have variable permeability to pollen
movement \cite{DyerSork2001,DyerEtAl2012}. In this study, a model is created to
simulate animal-mediated dispersion of pollen between plants.  This model is
used to examine the conseqeunces of movement assumptions and their interactions
with variation in plant density.

Pollen dispersal studies, for both abiotic and biotic pollen dispersal, have
assumed that the dispersal process is one of random diffusion.  While this may
be a good assumption for passively pollinated species, there is little evidence
that animals randomly diffuse across the landscape during pollination
\cite{LevinKerster}.  In fact, there are several examples of animal pollinators
exhibiting behavior that does not correspond to a random diffusion process, via
\emph{trap line} behavior \cite[e.g., repeated sequential visits to individual
plants]{OhashiThomson}.  Even for pollinator species that do not trapline, their
movement patterns do not resemble pure diffusion \cite{Cresswell03}. One
approach being applied to describe animal movement is through the use of
correlated random walk (CRW).  In these models, directionality is not random,
rather directionality and distance are based on the distribution derived from
the movement at the previous time step.  Models based upon CRW can have been
applied to a wide range of animal movement processes across varying ecological
contexts \cite{Bartumeus07,Byers01}, using deterministic diffusion
\cite{Klages}, and fractional Brownian motion \cite{Enriquez} approaches.

In this paper, an agent-based model (ABM) describing pollen movement, via animals
as a correlated random walk (CRW), is introduced. This model consist of agents
that interact with each other, using pre-defined rule sets, as they explore their
environment. Agent based models allow for simulations that consist of a large
number of interacting parts that would not be easily constructed otherwise
\cite{Fioretti05}. Agents can represent things such as people, animals,
organizations, etc. that interact with each other and their environment. The
environment in an ABM can represent things such as a spatial domain, or a
network in which the agents are connected to each other \cite{Gilbert}. Using
ABMs, the efficacy of CRW apporaches was examined in a system approximating
plant-pollinator interactions using computer simulations. Two statistics
describing pollinator movement (\emph{average path distance} and \emph{average
maximum distance}) were collected and parameters relevant to the plant
reproduction (\emph{average pollination distance}, \emph{average maximum
pollination distance}, and \emph{average weighted diversity of fathers}) are
collected and analyzed to describe how assumptions relating to agent movement
influence plant pollination dynamics.

It is shown that bias can be introduced by describing animal movement as a
purely random walk. That is, there is a significant difference between the model
outcomes for a purely random walk, as compared to a CRW. Thus, modeling animal
mediated pollen dispersal by way of a purely random diffusion process is likely
to result in errors in the approximation of the extent of pollen dispersal.
