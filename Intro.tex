Pollination is a critical component of every ecosystem, essential to creating and maintaining
diversity and reproduction, and required for world crop production \cite{KleinEtAl2007}.
The two main vectors for pollen movement are abiotic pollination where individual grains are
dispersed with through the aid of wind and/or water, and biotic pollination where an animal (most
commonly an insect) carry grains from one individual plant to another.  Given the size of individual pollen grains, direct monitoring of how pollen
is dispersed across the landscape is impractical.  Several indirect approaches have been developed
including the use of pollen traps and the application of genetic paternity approaches applied to
successfully pollinated seeds \cite{BitzerPatterson1967,StreiffEtAl1999}.  While these
approaches are able to quantify the end result of the dispersal process, they provide no direct information
the specifics of the transport mechanism.  This information is critical to understanding gene flow for a variety of reasons including
how to better understand how different features of
the landscape which have variable permeability affect pollen movement \cite{DyerSork2001,DyerEtAl2012}. In
this study, we simulate both passive and active dispersion of pollen between plants, and to examine the consequences of movement assumptions and their interactions
with variation in plant density.

Generally pollen dispersal studies**(add citations here), for both abiotic and biotic pollen dispersal, have assumed that pollen is distributed as a purely random diffusion.  While this may be a good assumption for abiotic
pollinated species, there is little evidence that animals randomly diffuse across the landscape
during pollination \cite{LevinKerster}.  In fact, there are several examples of animal pollinators
exhibiting \emph{trap line} behavior \cite[e.g., repeated sequential visits to individual
plants]{OhashiThomson}. Even for pollinator species that do not trapline, their movement patterns
do not resemble pure diffusion \cite{Cresswell03}. One approach to describe animal
movement is through the use of correlated random walks (CRW).  In these models, directionality is
not random but instead is based on the distribution about the direction taken
in the previous step.  Models based upon CRW have been applied to a wide range of animal
movement processes across varying ecological contexts \cite{Bartumeus07,Byers01}, using
deterministic diffusion \cite{Klages}, and fractional Brownian motion \cite{Enriquez} approaches.

In this paper, an agent-based model (ABM) used to simulate both biotic and abiotic pollination.  The model consist of moving agents, animals, that pollinate static agents, plants.  Movement is modeled using a correlated
random walk (CRW).  In particular for abiotic pollination we assume there is no correlation between consecutive steps, where for biotic pollination we assume there is correlation.

To better characterize the differences between biotic and abiotic pollination we examine several statistics describing pollinator movement
(\emph{average path distance} and \emph{average maximum distance}) and those relevant
to the plant reproduction (\emph{average pollination distance}, \emph{average maximum
pollination distance}, and \emph{average weighted diversity of fathers}).  We do this by looking at varying the strength of the correlation between consecutive steps of movement.

We show that on average pollination events occur at larger distances in moderately and highly correlated random walk compared to purely random walks.  This can results in higher genetic diversity among species with biotic dispersal than with abiotic dispersal. ({\bf Is that observed, Rodney?}) This suggests that care must be taken when studying plants that are pollinated by animals and appropriate models must be utilized.
