\begin{abstract} 
  Correlated random walk (CRW) models are a model of animal movement \cite{Prasad05} and have been
  successfully used to explore the movement of animals in varying ecological contexts
  \cite{Bartumeus07}. An agent-based model (ABM) is developed to describe pollen-mediated gene flow under 
  a correlated random walk (CRW). This model is used to explore how insect dispersal processes influence
  the movement of pollen  pollen
  distribution are affected by the varying turning angle and plant density.
