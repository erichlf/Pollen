\begin{abstract} 
  Correlated random walk (CRW) models are a model of animal movement
  \cite{Prasad05} and have been successfully used to explore the movement of
  animals in varying ecological contexts \cite{Bartumeus07}. In this paper we
  develop an agent-based model (ABM) is developed to describe pollen-mediated
  gene flow under a correlated random walk (CRW). This model is used to explore
  how insect dispersal processes influence the movement of pollen and pollen
  distribution by the varying turning angle and plant density.
